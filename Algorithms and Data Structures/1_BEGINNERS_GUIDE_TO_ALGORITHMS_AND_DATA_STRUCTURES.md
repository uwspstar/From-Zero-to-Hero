## Introduction

### What are Algorithms?
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing some end.

### What are Data Structures?
Data structures are ways to organize and store data so that they can be accessed and modified efficiently.

### Importance of Algorithms and Data Structures
Understanding algorithms and data structures is crucial for writing efficient code and solving complex problems.

## Getting Started with Programming

### Basic Programming Concepts
Programming involves writing instructions for a computer to perform specific tasks. Concepts include variables, control structures, data types, and syntax.

### Choosing a Programming Language
Select a language that aligns with your goals. Popular choices include Python, Java, and JavaScript.

### Writing Your First Program
Start with a simple "Hello, World!" program to familiarize yourself with the syntax and environment of your chosen language.

## Fundamental Data Structures

### Arrays

#### Definition and Usage
An array is a collection of elements, each identified by an index. They are used to store multiple values in a single variable.

#### Basic Operations (Access, Insert, Delete)
- **Access**: Retrieve an element by its index.
- **Insert**: Add an element at a specific position.
- **Delete**: Remove an element by its index.

#### Time and Space Complexity
- Access: \(O(1)\)
- Insert/Delete: \(O(n)\) for unsorted arrays, \(O(1)\) for append operations

### Linked Lists

#### Definition and Types (Singly, Doubly)
A linked list is a sequence of nodes, each containing data and a reference to the next node.
- **Singly Linked List**: Nodes have a reference to the next node.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Nodes have references to both the next and previous nodes.

#### Basic Operations (Traversal, Insert, Delete)
- **Traversal**: \(O(n)\)
- **Insert/Delete**: \(O(1)\) at the head, \(O(n)\) for arbitrary positions

#### Time and Space Complexity
- Access: \(O(n)\)
- Insert/Delete: \(O(1)\) at head, \(O(n)\) at arbitrary positions

### Stacks

#### Definition and Usage
A stack is a collection of elements with two principal operations: push (add an element to the top) and pop (remove the top element). It follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.

#### Basic Operations (Push, Pop, Peek)
- **Push**: Add an element to the top.
- **Pop**: Remove the top element.
- **Peek**: View the top element without removing it.

#### Time and Space Complexity
- Push/Pop/Peek: \(O(1)\)

### Queues

#### Definition and Types (Simple, Circular, Priority)
A queue is a collection of elements that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.
- **Simple Queue**: Basic queue with enqueue and dequeue operations.
- **Circular Queue**: A queue where the last position is connected back to the first position.
- **Priority Queue**: Elements are dequeued based on priority rather than order.

#### Basic Operations (Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek)
- **Enqueue**: Add an element to the end.
- **Dequeue**: Remove the element from the front.
- **Peek**: View the front element without removing it.

#### Time and Space Complexity
- Enqueue/Dequeue/Peek: \(O(1)\)

## Fundamental Algorithms

### Sorting Algorithms

#### Bubble Sort
A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\)

#### Selection Sort
An in-place comparison sort where the list is divided into a sorted and an unsorted region, and the smallest element from the unsorted region is selected and moved to the sorted region.
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\)

#### Insertion Sort
Builds the final sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly taking the next item and inserting it into the correct position.
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\)

### Searching Algorithms

#### Linear Search
A simple search algorithm that checks every element until the target element is found or the list ends.
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\)

#### Binary Search
An efficient search algorithm that works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(\log n)\)

## Introduction to Recursion

### What is Recursion?
Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem.

### How Recursion Works
A base case stops the recursion, and the recursive step reduces the problem size, gradually leading to the base case.

### Examples of Recursive Algorithms (Factorial, Fibonacci)
- **Factorial**: \(n! = n \times (n-1)!\)
- **Fibonacci**: \(F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)\)

## Basic Graph Theory

### What is a Graph?
A graph is a collection of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections between nodes).

### Terminology (Vertices, Edges, Paths)
- **Vertices**: The nodes in a graph.
- **Edges**: The connections between nodes.
- **Paths**: A sequence of vertices connected by edges.

### Types of Graphs (Directed, Undirected)
- **Directed Graph**: Edges have a direction.
- **Undirected Graph**: Edges do not have a direction.

### Representing Graphs (Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List)
- **Adjacency Matrix**: A 2D array where matrix[i][j] is true if there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j.
- **Adjacency List**: An array of lists where list[i] contains all vertices connected to vertex i.

## Basic Tree Structures

### What is a Tree?
A tree is a hierarchical structure with a root node and child nodes, forming a parent-child relationship.

### Terminology (Nodes, Root, Leaves)
- **Nodes**: The elements of a tree.
- **Root**: The top node in a tree.
- **Leaves**: Nodes with no children.

### Binary Trees

#### Definition and Properties
A binary tree is a tree where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

#### Basic Operations (Traversal, Insert, Delete)
- **Traversal**: In-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal.
- **Insert/Delete**: Adding and removing nodes.

### Binary Search Trees

#### Definition and Properties
A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree where the left child contains values less than the parent node and the right child contains values greater than the parent node.

#### Basic Operations (Search, Insert, Delete)
- **Search**: \(O(\log n)\) on average.
- **Insert**: \(O(\log n)\) on average.
- **Delete**: \(O(\log n)\) on average.
