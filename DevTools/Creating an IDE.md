# Creating an IDE 

Creating an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) similar to the layout of LeetCode's online coding platform, involves several key features. Here's a breakdown of what you'd need to consider to build an offline IDE, similar to VSCode, that allows you to solve coding problems like LeetCode:

### Key Features:

1. **User Interface:**
   - **Tabbed Interface:** Allow users to switch between different problem descriptions and their code files using tabs.
   - **Code Editor:** Implement a code editor with syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and other coding aids. You can use libraries like **Monaco Editor** (used by VSCode) or **CodeMirror**.
   - **Problem Description Pane:** On the left, there should be a pane to display problem descriptions, constraints, and example cases.
   - **Test Case Pane:** A section at the bottom where users can input test cases and view the results of their code.
   - **Output Window:** Display the runtime, errors, and other outputs from the code execution.
   - **Run and Submit Buttons:** Buttons to run the code and submit it for evaluation.
   - **Themes:** Include dark mode and light mode options.

2. **Core Functionality:**
   - **Language Support:** Allow multiple programming languages, such as Python, Java, C++, etc. Language support can be integrated using existing language servers (e.g., Python Language Server, Java Language Server).
   - **Run Code Locally:** Users should be able to execute their code locally, possibly using containers like Docker for isolated environments.
   - **Syntax Checking and Linting:** Integrate linters and formatters to help with coding style and syntax.
   - **Debugging Tools:** Basic debugging capabilities like setting breakpoints, stepping through code, and inspecting variables.

3. **Problem Management:**
   - **Problem Repository:** Include a local database or JSON files to store problem descriptions, constraints, and example cases.
   - **Problem Selection:** A menu or file explorer to browse and select coding problems.

4. **Test Case Management:**
   - **Custom Test Cases:** Users should be able to add custom test cases and see the output directly in the IDE.
   - **Auto-Validation:** Automatic validation against expected outputs.

5. **Extensions and Plugins:**
   - **Extensions:** Support for plugins or extensions, similar to VSCode, allowing users to add custom functionality.

6. **Offline Capability:**
   - **Local Execution:** All features, including code execution and problem solving, should work offline.
   - **Offline Problem Database:** Store problems locally so that they can be accessed and solved without an internet connection.

### Technologies to Use:

- **Frontend:**
  - **React.js or Electron:** For building the desktop application interface.
  - **Monaco Editor or CodeMirror:** For the code editor functionality.
  - **HTML/CSS:** For layout and styling.

- **Backend:**
  - **Node.js or Python:** For handling file operations, running code, and managing the local problem database.
  - **Docker:** For running code in isolated environments.

- **Database:**
  - **SQLite or JSON files:** To store problem descriptions, constraints, and user data locally.

### Steps to Build:

1. **Set Up the Project:**
   - Initialize a project with your chosen framework (React.js with Electron, for instance).

2. **Develop the User Interface:**
   - Create components for the editor, problem description pane, test case pane, and output window.
   - Add navigation for switching between problems and code files.

3. **Integrate Code Execution:**
   - Implement a backend server that can run code in different languages using Docker or directly using subprocesses (depending on security needs).

4. **Implement Problem Management:**
   - Set up a local database or JSON file system to store and retrieve problem data.
   - Create a UI for browsing and selecting problems.

5. **Add Custom Test Case Functionality:**
   - Enable users to input custom test cases and view results within the IDE.

6. **Testing and Debugging:**
   - Ensure all components work together seamlessly.
   - Test the application in various scenarios to ensure stability and offline functionality.

7. **Packaging:**
   - Package the application for different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) using Electron's packaging tools.

### Conclusion:

By following these steps, you can create an offline IDE similar to the one shown in the image. This IDE will allow users to practice coding problems, run code, and view results all within one platform, even without an internet connection.
