# Various authentication mechanisms, including session, cookie, JWT, token, SSO, and OAuth 2.0. 

Here is a summary of each method as depicted:

1. **WWW-Authenticate**:
   - **Illustration**: Browser sends username and password to the server.
   - **Issue**: Inability to control the login lifecycle.

2. **Session-Cookie**:
   - **Illustration**: Browser stores a cookie with a session ID, and the server maintains session state.
   - **Issue**: Doesn't support mobile apps.

3. **Token-Based Authentication**:
   - **Illustration**: Browser stores a token (sometimes in a cookie), and the server validates the token using a Token Validation Service.
   - **Benefit**: Reduces token validation cost.

4. **JWT (JSON Web Token)**:
   - **Illustration**: Token consists of a header, payload, and signature.
   - **Use Case**: Useful for cross-site login.

5. **SSO (Single Sign-On)**:
   - **Illustration**: Browser interacts with multiple services (e.g., a.com, b.com) via a central authentication service (sso.com).
   - **Benefit**: Allows cross-site login.

6. **OAuth 2.0**:
   - **Illustration**:
     - **Authorization Code**: Browser communicates with the authentication server via an intermediate server (a.com).
     - **Client Credentials**: Server-to-server authentication.
     - **Implicit Grant**: Direct communication between native apps (e.g., phone) and the authentication server.
     - **Password Grant**: Direct communication between the browser/server and the authentication server.
   - **Use Case**: Facilitates 3rd party access.
