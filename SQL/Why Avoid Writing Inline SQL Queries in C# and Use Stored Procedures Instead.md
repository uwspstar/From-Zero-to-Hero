### Why Avoid Writing Inline SQL Queries in C# and Use Stored Procedures Instead

When working with databases in applications, developers often face a choice between writing **inline SQL queries** directly in their application code or encapsulating the database logic in **stored procedures**. While inline SQL might seem simple and convenient at first, it comes with significant drawbacks, especially as your project scales. This article explores why stored procedures are a better alternative and demonstrates the key differences through examples.

### **The Problems with Inline SQL Queries**

Inline SQL queries refer to the practice of embedding SQL statements directly into your application code. Here's an example of an inline query in C#:

```csharp
string employeeId = "1 OR 1=1"; // Simulated malicious input
string query = $"SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE EmployeeID = {employeeId};";

using (SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection("YourConnectionString"))
{
    SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(query, conn);
    conn.Open();
    SqlDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader();

    while (reader.Read())
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{reader["Name"]} - {reader["Position"]}");
    }
}
```

#### **Major Drawbacks of Inline SQL**

1. **SQL Injection Risk**  
   Inline queries are prone to **SQL injection attacks** because user input is directly concatenated into the query string. An attacker can inject malicious SQL to bypass authentication, delete data, or retrieve sensitive information.  
   Example:  
   If `employeeId` is set to `1 OR 1=1`, the above query becomes:  
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE EmployeeID = 1 OR 1=1;
   ```
   This returns all rows in the `Employees` table instead of just the intended record.

2. **Performance Issues**  
   Inline SQL queries are not precompiled. Every time the query is executed, the database must parse and generate an execution plan, which adds unnecessary overhead.

3. **Poor Maintainability**  
   Inline SQL scatters database logic across your application code. If the query needs to be updated, you'll need to hunt through your codebase to find and modify every instance.

4. **Code Readability**  
   SQL mixed with application logic makes the code harder to read, understand, and debug. This violates the principle of **separation of concerns**.

5. **Lack of Reusability**  
   Inline queries are tied to a specific application and cannot be easily reused in other contexts, such as reporting tools or other systems.

### **Why Use Stored Procedures Instead**

Stored procedures are precompiled SQL statements stored in the database. They encapsulate database logic, making them reusable and secure. Here's how the above logic can be implemented using a stored procedure.

#### **Stored Procedure Example**

**Creating the Stored Procedure:**
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE usp_GetEmployeeByID
    @EmployeeID INT
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE EmployeeID = @EmployeeID;
END;
```

**Calling the Stored Procedure in C#:**
```csharp
using (SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection("YourConnectionString"))
{
    SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("usp_GetEmployeeByID", conn);
    cmd.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure;

    // Add parameter to prevent SQL injection
    cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@EmployeeID", 1);

    conn.Open();
    SqlDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader();

    while (reader.Read())
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{reader["Name"]} - {reader["Position"]}");
    }
}
```

### **Benefits of Using Stored Procedures**

1. **Enhanced Security**  
   Stored procedures use parameterized inputs, which protect against SQL injection attacks. The database treats user inputs as values, not executable code.  
   Example: Passing `1 OR 1=1` as input will not break the query logic because it is treated as a literal string.

2. **Improved Performance**  
   Stored procedures are precompiled and cached by the database. This reduces the overhead of parsing and execution plan generation, leading to faster execution.

3. **Centralized Logic and Maintainability**  
   By keeping SQL logic in stored procedures, you can centralize database operations in one place. This makes it easier to update, debug, and maintain your code.  
   Example: Updating a stored procedure's logic only requires a change in the database, without modifying the application code.

4. **Reusable and Shareable**  
   Stored procedures can be shared across multiple applications, making them a reusable component. They also help enforce consistent business logic.

5. **Better Error Handling**  
   Stored procedures can include error handling mechanisms (e.g., `TRY...CATCH` blocks), ensuring robust execution.

6. **Reduced Network Traffic**  
   When using stored procedures, only the procedure name and parameters are sent over the network, instead of the entire SQL query. This reduces network load, especially for complex queries.

### **Best Practices for Stored Procedures**

1. **Use Meaningful Names**  
   Adopt clear and descriptive naming conventions. For example:  
   - `usp_GetCustomerOrders`  
   - `usp_UpdateEmployeeSalary`

2. **Parameterize All Inputs**  
   Avoid dynamic SQL inside stored procedures unless absolutely necessary. Always use parameters to ensure security and performance.

3. **Handle Errors Gracefully**  
   Include error-handling logic to catch and log issues during execution:  
   ```sql
   BEGIN TRY
       -- SQL logic here
   END TRY
   BEGIN CATCH
       -- Log error details
       SELECT ERROR_MESSAGE() AS ErrorMessage;
   END CATCH;
   ```

4. **Avoid Over-Complexity**  
   Keep stored procedures focused on a single task. Break down large procedures into smaller, reusable ones to improve maintainability.

5. **Document Your Procedures**  
   Add comments to describe the purpose, parameters, and expected output of each stored procedure.

### **Inline SQL vs. Stored Procedures: A Quick Comparison**

| Feature                 | Inline SQL                      | Stored Procedure                |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Security**            | Prone to SQL injection         | Resistant with parameterization |
| **Performance**         | Query parsed every time         | Precompiled, optimized          |
| **Maintainability**     | Scattered across application    | Centralized in the database     |
| **Reusability**         | Tied to one application         | Can be shared across systems    |
| **Code Readability**    | SQL mixed with logic            | Clean separation of concerns    |

### **Conclusion**

While inline SQL might seem like a quick solution for database interactions, it introduces significant risks and challenges in security, performance, and maintainability. Stored procedures provide a robust alternative, offering enhanced security, better performance, and centralized database logic.

For modern applications, combining stored procedures with parameterized queries in your code ensures a clean, maintainable, and secure approach to database management. As you grow in your development career, adopting best practices like these will help you build scalable and efficient systems.
