# Optimizing Large File Uploads: A Comprehensive Approach

Large file uploads have always been a challenging area in software development, particularly when dealing with client-side performance, server-side efficiency, and network utilization. In this blog, I’ll walk you through my approach to designing and implementing a highly optimized and scalable file upload system.

## Redesigning the Upload Process

Traditional large file uploads usually follow a straightforward flow:
1. The client divides the file into chunks.
2. Each chunk and the full file hash are calculated on the client side.
3. These hashes are sent to the server to verify or initialize the upload.

While functional, this approach has significant drawbacks:
- **CPU-Intensive Hash Calculations**: Calculating hashes for large files (e.g., 10GB or more) can block the client for an unacceptable amount of time, even with Web Workers. Tests showed that hash computation could take over 30 seconds on underpowered machines.
- **Delayed Uploads**: Uploading cannot begin until all hashes are computed.

To address these challenges, I optimized the upload process with the following assumption:
> Most uploads involve new files.

With this assumption:
- **Immediate Uploads**: Chunks are uploaded as soon as they are ready, without waiting for the full file hash.
- **Deferred Hash Submission**: The full file hash is calculated and supplemented later, after the upload begins.

This approach eliminates delays and significantly improves user experience.

## A Standardized File Upload Protocol

Building on this optimized process, I designed a standardized protocol to streamline interactions between the client and server. The protocol consists of four main components:

1. **File Creation Protocol**:  
   The client sends file metadata (e.g., size, name, MIME type) via a `HEAD` request to the server. The server responds with a unique `uploadToken` that identifies the upload session. All subsequent requests must include this token.

2. **Hash Validation Protocol**:  
   The client sends chunk or file hashes to the server to verify their existence. The server responds with the current status of the chunks or file.

3. **Chunk Upload Protocol**:  
   The client uploads binary data for each chunk, accompanied by metadata like the chunk’s index and hash.

4. **Chunk Merging Protocol**:  
   Once all chunks are uploaded, the client sends a merge request to the server, signaling the completion of the upload.

## Tackling Frontend Challenges

The frontend plays a critical role in ensuring a seamless upload experience. I focused on two primary areas: **chunking logic** and **request flow control**.

### 1. Flexible Chunking Logic

Different scenarios require different chunking methods, such as:
- **Multithreaded Chunking**: Parallel computation to improve performance.
- **Time-Sliced Chunking**: Splitting based on time intervals, similar to React Fiber.
- **Custom Chunking**: Defined by the application’s specific requirements.

To accommodate these variations, I adopted the **template design pattern** using TypeScript.  
An abstract class defines the chunking process, while concrete subclasses implement specific hashing strategies. This approach ensures flexibility and extensibility.

### 2. Efficient Request Flow Control

Managing requests for a large number of chunks is critical for optimizing network usage. To address this:
- **Concurrent Requests**: I developed a concurrent request control class (`TaskQueue`) to maximize bandwidth utilization.
- **Event Management**: Using a custom `EventEmitter`, I enabled the system to emit events like upload progress, state changes, and completion notifications. This allows the application to react dynamically to these events.

## Addressing Backend Challenges

While the frontend focuses on user experience, the backend ensures the upload process is robust and efficient. The server-side implementation required addressing two major challenges: **chunk uniqueness** and **chunk merging**.

---

### 1. Ensuring Chunk Uniqueness

Uniqueness is critical for both storage and transmission:
- **Storage Uniqueness**: Each chunk must be stored only once, avoiding redundancy.
- **Transmission Uniqueness**: Each chunk must be uploaded only once.

To achieve this:
- **Decoupling Chunks and Files**: Chunks are stored independently of their parent files. Files are simply references to a sequence of chunks.
- **Never Deleting Chunks**: Even after files are "merged," chunks are retained to avoid redundant uploads in the future.

This approach ensures efficient storage and eliminates redundant transmissions.

---

### 2. Optimized Chunk Merging

Traditional merging involves combining chunks into a single large file. However, this process is:
- **Time-Consuming**: Merging large files can take significant time.
- **Redundant**: The merged file essentially duplicates existing chunk data.

Instead, I implemented a **logical merging** approach:
1. When a merge request is received, the server performs basic validations (e.g., file size, chunk count).
2. The server updates the file's status and generates an accessible URL in the database.
3. Actual file merging is deferred.

When a user requests the file:
- The server dynamically streams the chunks based on database records.
- A pipeline connects file streams directly to the network I/O for efficient delivery.

This method eliminates storage redundancy and improves merging efficiency.

## Key Takeaways

The optimized file upload system addresses the challenges of large file uploads with innovative solutions on both the frontend and backend:
- **Frontend**:
  - Immediate chunk uploads with deferred hash calculation.
  - Flexible chunking logic for diverse scenarios.
  - Efficient request control with concurrency and event-driven notifications.
- **Backend**:
  - Decoupled chunk and file storage for enhanced scalability.
  - Logical merging to minimize redundancy and improve response times.

By combining these elements, the system achieves high performance, scalability, and user satisfaction.

This project demonstrates how thoughtful design and a focus on user experience can overcome technical challenges, delivering a robust solution for large file uploads.
