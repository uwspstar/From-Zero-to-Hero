### **18 Essential Design Patterns Every Developer Should Know**

Design patterns are **reusable solutions** to common software design problems. They provide a shared language for developers, improve code organization, and promote best practices. Below is an explanation of 18 key design patterns, their purpose, and how they solve real-world challenges. A comparison table and sequence diagrams for select patterns are included for clarity.

### **Creational Patterns: Simplifying Object Creation**

1. **Abstract Factory: Family Creator**  
   **Purpose**: Creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.  
   **Example**: A UI toolkit that produces buttons, checkboxes, and text inputs for different platforms.  

   **Sequence Diagram**:
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
       participant Client as Client
       participant AbstractFactory as Abstract Factory
       participant ConcreteFactory as Concrete Factory
       participant Product as Product

       Client->>AbstractFactory: Request Object
       AbstractFactory->>ConcreteFactory: Delegate Creation
       ConcreteFactory->>Product: Create Product
       Product-->>Client: Return Object
   ```

2. **Builder: Lego Master**  
   **Purpose**: Constructs complex objects step by step, separating construction from representation.  
   **Example**: Building a car by adding parts like the engine, wheels, and seats.

3. **Prototype: Clone Maker**  
   **Purpose**: Creates new objects by cloning existing ones.  
   **Example**: Copying a pre-configured document template.  

   **Sequence Diagram**:
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
       participant Client as Client
       participant Prototype as Prototype

       Client->>Prototype: Clone Object
       Prototype-->>Client: Return New Object
   ```

4. **Singleton: One and Only**  
   **Purpose**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point.  
   **Example**: A database connection manager ensuring a single connection pool.

   **Sequence Diagram**:
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
       participant Client as Client
       participant Singleton as Singleton

       Client->>Singleton: Get Instance
       Singleton-->>Client: Return Single Instance
   ```

### **Structural Patterns: Organizing Objects and Classes**

5. **Adapter: Universal Plug**  
   **Purpose**: Converts the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect.  
   **Example**: Adapting a European plug to fit into an American outlet.  

   **Sequence Diagram**:
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
       participant Client as Client
       participant Adapter as Adapter
       participant Target as Target

       Client->>Adapter: Request
       Adapter->>Target: Translate Request
       Target-->>Adapter: Response
       Adapter-->>Client: Return Response
   ```

6. **Bridge: Function Connector**  
   **Purpose**: Decouples an object’s abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to vary independently.  
   **Example**: Separating device functionality (e.g., TV) from control mechanisms (e.g., remote control).

7. **Composite: Tree Builder**  
   **Purpose**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.  
   **Example**: A file system where files and folders form a hierarchy.

8. **Decorator: Customizer**  
   **Purpose**: Dynamically adds new functionality to objects without altering their structure.  
   **Example**: Adding scrollbars or borders to a text box.

9. **Facade: One-Stop-Shop**  
   **Purpose**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.  
   **Example**: A car dashboard simplifies interaction with complex subsystems.  

   **Sequence Diagram**:
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
       participant Client as Client
       participant Facade as Facade
       participant Subsystem as Subsystem

       Client->>Facade: Request
       Facade->>Subsystem: Simplify Request
       Subsystem-->>Facade: Return Result
       Facade-->>Client: Simplified Response
   ```

10. **Flyweight: Space Saver**  
    **Purpose**: Shares small, reusable objects to save memory.  
    **Example**: Reusing glyph objects for rendering text in a word processor.

11. **Proxy: Stand-In Actor**  
    **Purpose**: Acts as a placeholder or proxy for another object to control access.  
    **Example**: A virtual proxy for a heavy object like an image.  

    **Sequence Diagram**:
    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant Client as Client
        participant Proxy as Proxy
        participant RealObject as Real Object

        Client->>Proxy: Request
        Proxy->>RealObject: Forward Request
        RealObject-->>Proxy: Response
        Proxy-->>Client: Return Response
    ```

### **Behavioral Patterns: Managing Communication and Behavior**

12. **Chain of Responsibility: Request Relay**  
    **Purpose**: Passes a request along a chain of objects until it is handled.  
    **Example**: Event bubbling in a GUI where a click event is passed to parent elements.  

    **Sequence Diagram**:
    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant Client as Client
        participant Handler1 as Handler 1
        participant Handler2 as Handler 2

        Client->>Handler1: Request
        Handler1->>Handler2: Forward Request (if unhandled)
        Handler2-->>Client: Response
    ```

13. **Command: Task Wrapper**  
    **Purpose**: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing it to be parameterized or delayed.  
    **Example**: Implementing an undo feature by storing executed commands.

14. **Iterator: Collection Explorer**  
    **Purpose**: Provides a way to access elements in a collection sequentially.  
    **Example**: Iterating through a list of files in a directory.

15. **Mediator: Communication Hub**  
    **Purpose**: Simplifies communication between multiple objects by centralizing their interactions.  
    **Example**: A chatroom mediates communication between participants.

16. **Memento: Time Capsule**  
    **Purpose**: Captures and restores an object’s state without exposing its implementation.  
    **Example**: A text editor’s undo/redo functionality.

17. **Observer: News Broadcaster**  
    **Purpose**: Defines a dependency between objects so that when one changes state, all dependents are notified.  
    **Example**: A weather app updating its widgets when the forecast changes.

18. **Visitor: Skillful Guest**  
    **Purpose**: Adds new operations to existing classes without modifying them.  
    **Example**: A tax calculation system applying different rules to different transaction types.
