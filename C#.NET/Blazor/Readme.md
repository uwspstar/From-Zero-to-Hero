### C#.NET Blazor

#### What is Blazor?

**Blazor** is a modern web framework developed by Microsoft that allows developers to build interactive web applications using **C#** instead of JavaScript. It is part of the **ASP.NET Core** framework and enables the creation of rich user interfaces (UIs) based on reusable components. These components are typically defined in files with a `.razor` extension, which combine HTML markup with C# code, enhancing developer productivity through a syntax known as Razor.

Blazor supports two main hosting models:

1. **Blazor Server**: In this model, the application runs on the server, and UI updates are sent to the client over a SignalR connection. This allows for a responsive user experience while keeping the server in control of the application state.

2. **Blazor WebAssembly**: This model allows the application to run directly in the browser using WebAssembly, enabling client-side execution of C# code. This approach provides a more traditional single-page application (SPA) experience.

One of the key advantages of Blazor is its ability to leverage existing .NET libraries and tools, making it an attractive option for developers familiar with the .NET ecosystem. It also promotes a component-based architecture, which is beneficial for building scalable and maintainable applications.
