### Exception Handling in Threads in C#

In multithreaded applications, handling exceptions in threads requires a different approach compared to single-threaded applications. Unhandled exceptions in a thread can cause unexpected behaviors, and if not managed properly, may even terminate the entire application. This article covers various methods to handle exceptions in threads in C#.

---

### 1. Exception Handling in `Task` (Task Parallel Library)

In the Task Parallel Library (TPL), exceptions can be handled more easily. When a task throws an exception, it doesn’t propagate directly. Instead, the exception is stored within the task, and it can be retrieved later. This makes it easier to capture and handle exceptions in a structured way.

#### Example

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class Program
{
    public static async Task Main()
    {
        try
        {
            // Run task that will throw an exception
            Task task = Task.Run(() => ThrowException("Task Exception"));
            await task; // Await the task, which will throw the exception here
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Exception caught in Task: {ex.Message}");
        }
    }

    private static void ThrowException(string message)
    {
        throw new InvalidOperationException(message);
    }
}
```

#### Explanation
- When the `Task` throws an exception, the exception is stored in the task until it is awaited or accessed.
- The `await` operator retrieves the exception and allows it to be handled in the `try-catch` block in the calling code.

#### Advantages
- `Task` provides built-in exception handling, making it easy to handle multiple exceptions in an aggregated way.
- Supports `await` for asynchronous exception handling.

### 2. Exception Handling in Background Threads Using `Thread`

For background threads created using `Thread`, handling exceptions requires you to wrap the thread’s work in a `try-catch` block. Unlike tasks, exceptions thrown in a `Thread` are not automatically propagated to the main thread.

#### Example

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Thread thread = new Thread(() =>
        {
            try
            {
                ThrowException("Thread Exception");
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Exception caught in Thread: {ex.Message}");
            }
        });

        thread.Start();
        thread.Join(); // Wait for thread to finish
        Console.WriteLine("Thread has completed.");
    }

    private static void ThrowException(string message)
    {
        throw new InvalidOperationException(message);
    }
}
```

#### Explanation
- The exception is caught within the `try-catch` block inside the thread's delegate.
- This prevents the exception from crashing the application and allows the thread to handle its own exceptions.

#### Advantages
- Allows for localized exception handling within the thread, preventing unhandled exceptions from terminating the application.

### 3. Exception Handling in `Task.WaitAll` and `Task.WhenAll`

If you run multiple tasks and want to wait for all of them, you can use `Task.WaitAll` (synchronous) or `Task.WhenAll` (asynchronous) to handle any exceptions thrown by individual tasks. Exceptions are stored in an `AggregateException`, which contains all exceptions thrown by the tasks.

#### Example

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class Program
{
    public static async Task Main()
    {
        Task task1 = Task.Run(() => ThrowException("Task 1 Exception"));
        Task task2 = Task.Run(() => ThrowException("Task 2 Exception"));

        try
        {
            // Wait for all tasks to complete and handle exceptions
            await Task.WhenAll(task1, task2);
        }
        catch (AggregateException ex)
        {
            foreach (var innerException in ex.InnerExceptions)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Exception caught in Task: {innerException.Message}");
            }
        }
    }

    private static void ThrowException(string message)
    {
        throw new InvalidOperationException(message);
    }
}
```

#### Explanation
- When multiple tasks throw exceptions, they are wrapped in an `AggregateException`.
- `AggregateException.InnerExceptions` provides access to all individual exceptions.

#### Advantages
- Allows for handling multiple exceptions from multiple tasks in a single catch block.
- Enables centralized exception handling for task groups.

---

### 4. Using `Task.Exception` Property to Retrieve Exceptions

If you need to handle exceptions later, you can access them through the `Exception` property of the task. This property contains the `AggregateException` with all exceptions thrown by the task.

#### Example

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Task task = Task.Run(() => ThrowException("Deferred Task Exception"));

        try
        {
            task.Wait(); // Blocking wait to force the exception
        }
        catch (AggregateException ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Exception caught: {ex.InnerException?.Message}");
        }
    }

    private static void ThrowException(string message)
    {
        throw new InvalidOperationException(message);
    }
}
```

#### Explanation
- The `task.Wait()` method throws an `AggregateException`, allowing you to handle it synchronously.
- This approach is useful if you don’t want to use `await` or need to defer exception handling.

### 5. Global Exception Handling in Threads

In some cases, you may want to catch all unhandled exceptions from background threads at a global level. This can be done by subscribing to the `AppDomain.UnhandledException` event.

#### Example

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException += (sender, e) =>
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Unhandled exception caught: {(e.ExceptionObject as Exception)?.Message}");
        };

        Thread thread = new Thread(() => ThrowException("Global Thread Exception"));
        thread.Start();

        thread.Join();
        Console.WriteLine("Thread has completed.");
    }

    private static void ThrowException(string message)
    {
        throw new InvalidOperationException(message);
    }
}
```

#### Explanation
- `AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException` allows you to handle unhandled exceptions at a global level.
- This approach is suitable for logging or handling critical failures.

#### Warning
- This event catches unhandled exceptions globally, and some may still terminate the application.
- Avoid using this approach for general exception handling; it’s best used for logging critical errors.

| **`Task.Exception` Property**          | Retrieves deferred exceptions from tasks             | For synchronous exception handling               |

### Summary

Exception handling in threads in C# requires different techniques depending on whether you’re using `Task` or `Thread`. With `Task`, you can use `await`, `Task.WhenAll`, and `AggregateException` to handle exceptions efficiently. For `Thread`, wrapping the code in `try-catch` blocks is essential to avoid unexpected application termination.

In some cases, global exception handling via `AppDomain.UnhandledException` can be used, though it’s primarily for logging critical errors. Choosing the right method ensures that exceptions are properly managed, keeping your multithreaded applications stable and resilient.
