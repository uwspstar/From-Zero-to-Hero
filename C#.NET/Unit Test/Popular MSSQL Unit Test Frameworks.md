### Popular MSSQL Unit Test Frameworks

When unit testing SQL Server (MSSQL) code, several frameworks can help facilitate test creation, setup, and validation. Here are some popular choices:

1. **tSQLt** – A dedicated SQL unit testing framework with rich support for mocking and isolation in SQL Server.
2. **Microsoft SQL Server Unit Testing** – Built into Visual Studio, this tool integrates well with other Microsoft development tools.
3. **DbUnit** – Often used in Java environments for database testing, it can work with SQL Server through JDBC.
4. **xUnit with Entity Framework Core** – Though primarily used for application-level testing, xUnit with Entity Framework is a practical choice for integration testing of SQL databases.
5. **SQLTest** – A commercial tool that integrates with SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to run unit tests for SQL code.

Among these, **tSQLt** is widely used due to its specialized SQL testing capabilities. Below is a code example of how to set up and use tSQLt for MSSQL unit testing.

### Example Code for tSQLt

The following example demonstrates a basic unit test using tSQLt to test a stored procedure in SQL Server.

#### Step 1: Install tSQLt
1. Download the latest version of tSQLt from the [tSQLt website](https://tsqlt.org/).
2. Execute the `tSQLt.class.sql` script in your SQL Server database to set up tSQLt.

#### Step 2: Create Sample Schema and Procedure

Suppose we have a simple stored procedure that calculates the total sales for a specific customer.

```sql
-- Create a schema for the application
CREATE SCHEMA Sales;

-- Create a table to store sales records
CREATE TABLE Sales.SalesRecord (
    CustomerId INT,
    Amount DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Stored procedure to calculate total sales for a customer
CREATE PROCEDURE Sales.CalculateTotalSales
    @CustomerId INT
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @TotalSales DECIMAL(10, 2);
    
    SELECT @TotalSales = SUM(Amount)
    FROM Sales.SalesRecord
    WHERE CustomerId = @CustomerId;
    
    RETURN @TotalSales;
END;
```

#### Step 3: Create a Test Case Using tSQLt

Using tSQLt, you can isolate dependencies and create test cases. Here’s how you would set up a unit test for `CalculateTotalSales`.

```sql
-- Enable tSQLt for this database
EXEC tSQLt.NewTestClass 'SalesTests';

-- Test case for Sales.CalculateTotalSales stored procedure
CREATE PROCEDURE SalesTests.[test CalculateTotalSales_ReturnsCorrectTotal]
AS
BEGIN
    -- Arrange
    -- Clear the SalesRecord table to ensure a clean test environment
    EXEC tSQLt.FakeTable 'Sales.SalesRecord';

    -- Insert sample data
    INSERT INTO Sales.SalesRecord (CustomerId, Amount)
    VALUES (1, 100.00), (1, 200.00), (2, 50.00);

    -- Act
    DECLARE @Result DECIMAL(10, 2);
    EXEC @Result = Sales.CalculateTotalSales @CustomerId = 1;

    -- Assert
    EXEC tSQLt.AssertEquals @Expected = 300.00, @Actual = @Result;
END;
```

#### Explanation of the Test

1. **Arrange**: Sets up the test environment by using `tSQLt.FakeTable` to isolate the `SalesRecord` table and inserting sample data.
2. **Act**: Calls the `CalculateTotalSales` procedure with a test `CustomerId` of 1.
3. **Assert**: Verifies that the result is correct by comparing the returned total sales amount with the expected value using `tSQLt.AssertEquals`.

#### Running the Test

To run the test, use the following command:

```sql
EXEC tSQLt.Run 'SalesTests.[test CalculateTotalSales_ReturnsCorrectTotal]';
```

This will execute the test and provide feedback on whether it passed or failed, along with any relevant details.

By using **tSQLt** and other frameworks like **SQLTest** or **Microsoft SQL Server Unit Testing**, you can create reliable, isolated unit tests for SQL Server code. These frameworks support a wide range of SQL testing scenarios, from verifying stored procedure logic to ensuring data integrity across complex transactions.
