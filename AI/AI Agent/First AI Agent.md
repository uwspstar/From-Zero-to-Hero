## 🧠 Goal Recap

You want to build an **AI Agent** that:

1. Reads a Swagger file (`swagger.json`)
2. Understands all the API endpoints inside it
3. Automatically creates C# `xUnit` test code (with `HttpClient`)
4. Saves the result into a file, ready to test your API

This whole process should be done **automatically**, like a smart assistant.

---

## 🧩 What is the “AI Agent” Here?

The AI agent is **a small program (like the one we built in `Program.cs`)** that:

* Acts **smart**, by understanding Swagger's structure
* Uses some logic to **guess what tests to write**
* And **generates test code** that humans usually write manually

It doesn't "talk" like ChatGPT, but it **behaves smartly** with automation.

## 🛠 How the Agent Works — Step-by-Step

Here’s the entire process visually and with explanation:

```
[swagger.json] 
   ↓
[AI Agent (Program.cs)]
   → Step 1: Read and Parse Swagger File
   → Step 2: Loop through each API endpoint
   → Step 3: For each endpoint, decide:
       - Method (GET, POST, etc.)
       - URL
       - Status Code
   → Step 4: Write matching test code
   → Step 5: Save everything to GeneratedApiTests.cs
   ↓
[GeneratedApiTests.cs]
   ↓
[dotnet test]  ← You run this to test your real API
```

## 🧪 Example for One API Endpoint

### Swagger says:

```json
{
  "paths": {
    "/api/users": {
      "get": {
        "responses": {
          "200": {
            "description": "Success"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### The AI Agent generates this:

```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task Get_api_users_ShouldReturn200()
{
    var response = await _client.GetAsync("/api/users");
    Assert.Equal(HttpStatusCode.OK, response.StatusCode);
}
```

Isn’t that cool? You don’t have to write it by hand!

## 🏗️ How to Use It All — Complete Walkthrough

### ✅ 1. Setup .NET Project

```bash
dotnet new console -n SwaggerTestGen
cd SwaggerTestGen
```

### ✅ 2. Add Required Packages

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.OpenApi.Readers
dotnet add package xunit
```

### ✅ 3. Replace `Program.cs` with Our Code (from previous step)

Copy/paste the full `Program.cs` from earlier into your project.

### ✅ 4. Add Swagger File

Save your Swagger/OpenAPI JSON file as `swagger.json` in the same folder.

### ✅ 5. Run the AI Agent to Generate Tests

```bash
dotnet run
```

➡️ You’ll get a file called `GeneratedApiTests.cs`.

---

## 🧪 BONUS: How to Run the Tests?

If you already have a test project (e.g., `MyApi.Tests`), just **copy** the `GeneratedApiTests.cs` file into it.

If not:

```bash
dotnet new xunit -n MyApiTests
cd MyApiTests
```

Then move `GeneratedApiTests.cs` here, and run:

```bash
dotnet test
```

🎉 Done! You just created a simple **AI agent that writes tests for you**!

## 🔮 Next Level (Optional)

You can upgrade your agent later to:

| Feature                         | Description                                      |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Auto-generate **POST body**     | Detect body schema and create sample JSON        |
| Read `servers` base URL         | Automatically set `HttpClient.BaseAddress`       |
| Generate test **for 400 / 500** | Not just success but also error cases            |
| Detect **auth tokens** needed   | Add `Authorization: Bearer xxx` header if needed |
